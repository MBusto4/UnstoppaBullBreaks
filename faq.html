    <h3> 1. What is case breaking?</h3>
    <p>Case breaking is a community based way to open a box of cards. It is a very affordable way to get a chance to open a box of cards that you would not typically be able to afford or want to pay full price for. The community of buyers will
      essentially split a box or case of cards and have a chance at a portion of the cards in the case break. For example, a 2019-20 National Treasures Football case costs over $4,000. This case break would consist of 4 boxes. Instead of paying
      $4,000, the buyer can purchase one team or a random team in the case break. The buyer will win all cards that are pulled from their assigned team. That way, at an affordable cost, the buyer has a chance to hit a HUGE card!</p>

    <h3>2. What happens if I do not win a card?</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, the buyer will not always win a card in a case break. There will be some breaks where there are cards guaranteed. If you do not win a card, unfortunately that is the risk you take with a case break purchase and there will be no
      compensation. Better luck next time!</p>

    <h3>3. Can you sell what I win?</h3>
    <p>Yes, UnstoppaBull Breaks offers a consignment service. Just fill out the form on the consignment page of the website and email it to jpisciotti@unstoppabullbreaks.comS</p>

    <h3>4. Where can I watch the breaks?</h3>
    <p>The breaks will be hosted via YouTube live on Unstoppabull Breaks Youtube page. The link to the live streams are posted on our twitter @UBCards.</p>


    <h3>5. When will my cards ship?</h3>
    <p>Cards will ship out every Saturday. All cards are shipped via USPS First Class with tracking.</p>


    <h3>6. Can I buy multiple spots?</h3>
    <p>Yes, buyers can purchase as many spots as they would like in each break.</p>


    <h3>7. What are the different types of breaks?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Random Team- The names of the buyers and Team Names will be randomized on live stream. Each buyer will randomly be assigned a team, and will win every card that is pulled from that break from their team. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>PYT- Pick your team. In these breaks, each team is assigned a different value depending on the amount and quality of hits each case contains. For example, The NY Giants are one of the most expensive teams in NFL breaks because they host
          Daniel Jones Rookie cards. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Random #s- Random numbers is a fun way top break. Every buyer will be awarded a number 0-9 on the randomizer. If the pulled card is a numbered variation, for example 12/99 than the 2 spot would win the card. The second digit of the first
          number is used. If the card is not numbered, the last digit of the serial number will be used. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> Hit Draft- In this format, everyone will receive a card. The names will be randomized to form a numbered list. After all cards are opened, the cards will be chosen in a snake draft by the buyers. The top name on the randomizer will get
          the first pick out of the pulled hits. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. Are there refunds?</h3>
    <p>There are no refunds on case break purchases.</p>



    <h3>9. Are there discounts?</h3>
    <p>New buyers can use code "NEW10" for 10% off their first purchase. After that, buyers have a chance to join the VIP Program that is $10 a month but will give them 5% off all purchases. Buyers will quickly make their money back on this by
      purchasing into breaks.
